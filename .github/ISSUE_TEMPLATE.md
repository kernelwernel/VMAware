## Description


## CLI output (if possible)
> [!NOTE]
> It's highly recommended to copy paste the full output here with the debug binary in the [release section](https://github.com/kernelwernel/VMAware/releases/latest) (which looks like vmaware_debug_X.X.X.exe). If you want to compile from the main branch instead, make sure to add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` to your cmake arguments.
