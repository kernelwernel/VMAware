## `VM::detect()`

This is basically the main function you're looking for, which returns a bool. If the parameter is set to nothing, all the recommended checks will be performed. But you can optionally set what techniques are used.

```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"

int main() {
    /**
     * The basic way to detect a VM where the default checks will 
     * be performed. This is the recommended usage of the lib.
     */ 
    bool is_vm = VM::detect();


    /**
     * This does the exact same as above, but as an explicit alternative.
     */ 
    bool is_vm2 = VM::detect(VM::DEFAULT);


    /**
     * All checks are performed including spoofable techniques
     * and a few other techniques that are disabled by default,
     * one of which is VM::CURSOR which waits 5 seconds for any 
     * human mouse interaction to detect automated virtual environments.
     * If you're fine with having a 5 second delay, add VM::ALL 
     */ 
    bool is_vm3 = VM::detect(VM::ALL);


    /**
     * If you don't want the value to be memoized for whatever reason, 
     * you can set the VM::NO_MEMO flag and the result will not be cached. 
     * It's recommended to use this flag if you're only using one function
     * from the public interface a single time in total, so no unneccessary 
     * caching will be operated when you're not going to re-use the previously 
     * stored result at the end. 
     */ 
    bool is_vm4 = VM::detect(VM::NO_MEMO);


    /**
     * This will set the threshold bar to detect a VM higher than the default threshold.
     * Use this if you want to be extremely sure if it's a VM, but this can risk the result
     * to be a false negative. Use VM::percentage() for a more precise result if you want.
     */ 
    bool is_vm5 = VM::detect(VM::HIGH_THRESHOLD);


    /**
     * Essentially means only the CPU brand, MAC, and hypervisor bit techniques 
     * should be performed. Note that the less flags you provide, the more 
     * likely the result will not be accurate. If you just want to check for 
     * a single technique, use VM::check() instead. Also, read the flag table
     * at the end of this doc file for a full list of technique flags.
     */
    bool is_vm6 = VM::detect(VM::CPU_BRAND, VM::MAC, VM::HYPERVISOR_BIT);


    /**
     * If you want to disable any technique for whatever reason, use VM::DISABLE(...).
     * This code snippet essentially means "perform all the default flags, but only 
     * disable the VM::RDTSC technique". 
     */ 
    bool is_vm7 = VM::detect(VM::DISABLE(VM::RDTSC));


    /**
     * Same as above, but you can disable multiple techniques at the same time.
     */ 
    bool is_vm8 = VM::detect(VM::DISABLE(VM::VMID, VM::RDTSC, VM::HYPERVISOR_BIT));


    /**
     * This is just an example to show that you can use a combination of 
     * different flags and non-technique flags with the above examples. 
     */ 
    bool is_vm9 = VM::detect(VM::DEFAULT, VM::NO_MEMO, VM::HIGH_THRESHOLD, VM::DISABLE(VM::RDTSC, VM::VMID));

}
```

<br>

## `VM::percentage()`
This will return a `std::uint8_t` between 0 and 100. It'll return the certainty of whether it has detected a VM based on all the techniques available as a percentage. The lower the value, the less chance it's a VM. The higher the value, the more likely it is. 

```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint>

int main() {
    // uint8_t and unsigned char works too
    const std::uint8_t percent = VM::percentage();

    if (percent == 100) {
        std::cout << "Definitely a VM!\n";
    } else if (percent == 0) {
        std::cout << "Definitely NOT a VM\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Unsure if it's a VM\n";
    }

    // converted to std::uint32_t for console character encoding reasons
    std::cout << "percentage: " << static_cast<std::uint32_t>(percent) << "%\n"; 
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> you can use the same flag system as shown with `VM::detect()` for this function.

<br>

## `VM::brand()`
This will essentially return the VM brand as a `std::string`. All the brands are listed [here](#brand-table)

If none were detected, it will return `Unknown`. It should be noted that this could be a common scenario even if you're running inside a VM due to technical difficulties with accomplishing this. This is especially true for VMware sub-versions (ESX, GSX, Fusion, etc...). It's not recommended to rely on this function for critical operations as if your whole program depends on it.

```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"
#include <string>

int main() {
    const std::string result = VM::brand();

    if (result == "KVM") {
        // do KVM specific stuff
    } else if (result == "VirtualBox") {
        // do vbox specific stuff
    } else {
        // you get the idea
    }
}
```


On rare occasions, there might be cases where there's multiple brands that have been detected, which might cause a conflicting output with an inaccurate result. To prevent this, you can use the `VM::MULTIPLE` flag that returns a **message** rather than a **VM brand string**. For example, if it found 2 conflicting brands, it will return `VMware or VirtualBox`. For 3 conflicts, it's `VMware or VirtualBox or QEMU` and so on.


```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"
#include <string>

int main() {
    // format: "vmbrand1 or vmbrand2 [or vmbrandx...]"
    const std::string result = VM::brand(VM::MULTIPLE);

    // example output: "VMware or Bochs"
    std::cout << result << "\n";

    // Keep in mind that there's no limit to how many conflicts there can be.
    // And if there's no conflict, it'll revert back to giving the brand string
    // normally as if the VM::MULTIPLE wasn't there
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> you can use the same flag system as shown with `VM::detect()` for `VM::brand()`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `VM::MULTIPLE` has no effect for any other function other than `VM::brand()`


<br>

## `VM::check()`
This takes a single technique argument and returns a `bool`. It essentially returns a technique's effective output. Nothing more, nothing less.


```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    if (VM::check(VM::VMID)) {
        std::cout << "VMID technique detected a VM!\n";
    }

    if (VM::check(VM::HYPERVISOR_BIT)) {
        std::cout << "Hypervisor bit is set, most definitely a VM!\n";
    }
}
```

<br>

## `VM::add_custom()`
This function allows you to add your own custom VM detection techniques to the scoring system. The first parameter is the percentage score (0 to 100) of how likely it's a VM if your custom code returns `true`, and the second parameter should either be a lambda, a function pointer, or a `std::function<bool()>`

```cpp
// Example 1 with function pointers

bool new_technique() {
    // add your VM detection code here
    return true; 
}

VM::add_custom(50, new_technique);
```

```cpp
// Example 2 with lambdas

VM::add_custom(50, []() -> bool { 
    // add your VM detection code here
    return true; 
});

auto new_technique = []() -> bool { 
    // add your VM detection code here
    return true;
}

VM::add_custom(50, new_technique);
```

```cpp
// Example 3 with std::function

std::function<bool()> new_technique = []() -> bool {
    // add your VM detection code here
    return true;
};

VM::add_custom(50, new_technique);
```

<br>

## `VM::type()`
This will return the VM type (or architecture) as a `std::string` based on the brand found. The possible return values are listed [here](#brand-table) in the `type` column.

```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // example output: VirtualBox is a Hypervisor (type 2) VM
    std::cout << VM::brand() " is a " << VM::type() << " VM\n";
}
```


<br>

## `VM::conclusion()`
This will return the "conclusion" message of what the overall result is as a `std::string`. By default, there are 2 possible outputs:
- `Running on baremetal`
- `Running inside a [brand] VM`

The `[brand]` part might contain a brand or may as well be empty, depending on whether a brand has been found. Additionally, you can extend this by adding the `VM::DYNAMIC` flag which will now allow much more variadic  potential outputs:
- `Running on baremetal`
- `Very unlikely a [brand] VM`
- `Unlikely a [brand] VM`
- `Potentially a [brand] VM`
- `Might be a [brand] VM`
- `Likely a [brand] VM`
- `Very likely a [brand] VM`
- `Running inside a [brand] VM`


<br>

## `VM::detected_count()`
This will fetch the number of techniques that have been detected as a `std::uint8_t`. Can't get any more simpler than that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, how's your day btw?

<br>

# vmaware struct
If you prefer having an object to store all the relevant information about the program's environment instead of calling static member functions, you can use the `VM::vmaware` struct:

```cpp
struct vmaware {
    std::string brand;
    std::string type;
    std::string conclusion;
    bool is_vm;
    std::uint8_t percentage;
    std::uint8_t detected_count;
    std::uint8_t technique_count;
}; 
```

example:
```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    VM::vmaware vm;

    std::cout << "Is this a VM? = " << vm.is_vm << "\n";
    std::cout << "How many techniques detected a VM? = " << vm.detected_count << "%\n";
    std::cout << "What's the VM's type? = " << vm.type << "%\n";
    std::cout << "What's the overview in a human-readable message?" << vm.conclusion << "\n";
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> the flag system is compatible for the struct constructor.

# Flag table
VMAware provides a convenient way to not only check for VMs, but also have the flexibility and freedom for the end-user to choose what techniques are used with complete control over what gets executed or not. This is handled with a flag system.

# Setting flags
| Flag | Description | Specific to |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `VM::ALL` | This will enable all the technique flags, including checks that are disabled by default. |  |
| `VM::NO_MEMO` | This will disable memoization, meaning the result will not be fetched through a previous computation of the techniques. For example, if you run all the techniques with VM::detect(), this will save all the technique results in a small cache and if you decide to use VM::percentage() afterwards, the result for that function will retrieve the precomputed results from that cache. Use this if you're only using a single total number of functions from the `VM` struct so that no unnecessary caching will be performed. |  |
| `VM::DEFAULT` | This represents a range of flags which are enabled if no default argument is provided. |
| `VM::MULTIPLE` | This will basically return a `std::string` message of what brands could be involved. For example, it could return "`VMware or VirtualBox`" instead of having a single brand string output. | VM::brand() |   
| `VM::HIGH_THRESHOLD` | This will set the threshold bar to confidently detect a VM by 3x higher. | VM::detect() and VM::percentage() |
| `VM::DYNAMIC` | This will add 8 options to the conclusion message rather than 2, each with their own varying likelihoods. | VM::conclusion() |
| `VM::NULL_ARG` | Does nothing, meant as a placeholder flag mainly for CLI purposes. It's best to ignore this.|  |

<br>

# Variables
| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `VM::technique_count` | `std::uint16_t` | This will store the number of VM detection techniques |
| `VM::technique_vector` | `std::vector<std::uint8_t>` | This will store all the technique macros as a vector. Useful if you're trying to loop through all the techniques for whatever operation you're performing. |

<br>

# CLI documentation
| Shorthand | Full command | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| -h | --help | Prints the help menu |
| -v | --version | Prints the version and miscellaneous details |
| -d | --detect | Prints the VM detection result (1 = VM, 0 = baremetal) |
| -s | --stdout | Returns either 0 or 1 to STDOUT without any text output (0 = VM, 1 = baremetal) |
| -b | --brand | Prints the most likely brand |
| -l | --brand-list | Prints all the possible VM brand strings the CLI supports |
| -c | --conclusion | Prints the conclusion message string |
| -p | --percent | Prints the VM likeliness percentage between 0 and 100 |
| -n | --number | Prints the number of VM detection techniques it can perform |
| -t | --type | Returns the VM type (if a VM was found) |
|    | --disable-notes | No notes will be provided |
|    | --high-threshold | A higher theshold bar for a VM detection will be applied |
|    | --no-color | Removes all the color, this is added due to some terminals not supporting ANSI escape codes while cluttering the output |
|    | --dynamic | allow the conclusion message to be dynamic (8 possibilities instead of only 2) |
|    | --verbose | add more information to the output  |
|    | --compact | ignore the unsupported techniques from the CLI output and thus make it more compact |
|    | --mit | ignore the GPL techniques and run only the MIT-supported ones |
> [!NOTE]
> If you want a general result with the default settings, do not put any arguments. This is the intended way to use the CLI tool.
