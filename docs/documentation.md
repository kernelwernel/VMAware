## `VM::detect()`

This is basically the main function you're looking for, which returns a bool. If the parameter is set to nothing, all the recommended checks will be performed. But you can optionally set what techniques are used.

```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"

int main() {
    /**
     * The basic way to detect a VM where the default checks will 
     * be performed. This is the recommended usage of the lib.
     */ 
    bool is_vm = VM::detect();


    /**
     * This does the exact same as above, but as an explicit alternative.
     */ 
    bool is_vm2 = VM::detect(VM::DEFAULT);


    /**
     * All checks are performed including spoofable techniques
     * and a few other techniques that are disabled by default
     * for a variety of reasons. Only 1 or 2 techniques are 
     * disabled by default, and this flag will include both of 
     * them. This isn't the default due to potential instability 
     * concerns, but if that's fine for you then use this flag 
     * for the sake of completeness.
     */ 
    bool is_vm3 = VM::detect(VM::ALL);


    /**
     * This will set the threshold bar to detect a VM higher than the default threshold.
     * Use this if you want to be extremely sure if it's a VM, but this can risk the result
     * to be a false negative. Use VM::percentage() for a more precise result if you want.
     */ 
    bool is_vm4 = VM::detect(VM::HIGH_THRESHOLD);


    /**
     * Essentially means only the CPU brand, MAC, and hypervisor bit techniques 
     * should be performed. Note that the less flags you provide, the more 
     * likely the result will not be accurate. If you just want to check for 
     * a single technique, use VM::check() instead. Also, read the flag table
     * at the end of this doc file for a full list of technique flags.
     */
    bool is_vm5 = VM::detect(VM::CPU_BRAND, VM::MAC, VM::HYPERVISOR_BIT);


    /**
     * If you want to disable any technique for whatever reason, use VM::DISABLE(...).
     * This code snippet essentially means "perform all the default flags, but only 
     * disable the VM::RDTSC technique". 
     */ 
    bool is_vm6 = VM::detect(VM::DISABLE(VM::RDTSC));


    /**
     * Same as above, but you can disable multiple techniques at the same time.
     */ 
    bool is_vm7 = VM::detect(VM::DISABLE(VM::VMID, VM::RDTSC, VM::HYPERVISOR_BIT));


    /**
     * If you don't want the value to be memoized for whatever reason, 
     * you can set the VM::NO_MEMO flag and the result will not be cached. 
     * It's recommended to use this flag if you're only using one function
     * from the public interface a single time in total, so no unneccessary 
     * caching will be operated when you're not going to re-use the previously 
     * stored result at the end. 
     */ 
    bool is_vm8 = VM::detect(VM::NO_MEMO);


    /**
     * This is just an example to show that you can use a combination of 
     * different flags and non-technique flags with the above examples. 
     */ 
    bool is_vm9 = VM::detect(VM::DEFAULT, VM::NO_MEMO, VM::HIGH_THRESHOLD, VM::DISABLE(VM::RDTSC, VM::VMID));
}
```

<br>

## `VM::percentage()`
This will return a `std::uint8_t` between 0 and 100. It'll return the certainty of whether it has detected a VM based on all the techniques available as a percentage. The lower the value, the less chance it's a VM. The higher the value, the more likely it is. 

```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint>

int main() {
    // uint8_t and unsigned char works too
    const std::uint8_t percent = VM::percentage();

    if (percent == 100) {
        std::cout << "Definitely a VM!\n";
    } else if (percent == 0) {
        std::cout << "Definitely NOT a VM\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Unsure if it's a VM\n";
    }

    // converted to std::uint32_t for console character encoding reasons
    std::cout << "percentage: " << static_cast<std::uint32_t>(percent) << "%\n"; 

    return 0;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> you can use the same flag system as shown with `VM::detect()` for this function.

<br>

## `VM::brand()`
This will essentially return the VM brand as a `std::string`. All the brands are listed [here](#brand-table)

If none were detected, it will return `Unknown`. It should be noted that this could be a common scenario even if you're running inside a VM due to technical difficulties with accomplishing this. This is especially true for VMware sub-versions (ESX, GSX, Fusion, etc...). It's not recommended to rely on this function for critical operations as if your whole program depends on it.

```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"
#include <string>

int main() {
    const std::string result = VM::brand();

    if (result == "KVM") {
        // do KVM specific stuff
    } else if (result == "VirtualBox") {
        // do vbox specific stuff
    } else {
        // you get the idea
    }

    return 0;
}
```


On rare occasions, there might be cases where there's multiple brands that have been detected, which might cause a conflicting output with an inaccurate result. To prevent this, you can use the `VM::MULTIPLE` flag that returns a **message** rather than a **VM brand string**. For example, if it found 2 conflicting brands, it will return `VMware or VirtualBox`. For 3 conflicts, it's `VMware or VirtualBox or QEMU` and so on.


```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"
#include <string>

int main() {
    // format: "vmbrand1 or vmbrand2 [or vmbrandx...]"
    const std::string result = VM::brand(VM::MULTIPLE);

    // example output: "VMware or Bochs"
    std::cout << result << "\n";

    // Keep in mind that there's no limit to how many conflicts there can be.
    // And if there's no conflict, it'll revert back to giving the brand string
    // normally as if the VM::MULTIPLE wasn't there

    return 0;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> you can use the same flag system as shown with `VM::detect()` for `VM::brand()`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `VM::MULTIPLE` has no effect for any other function other than `VM::brand()`


<br>

## `VM::check()`
This takes a single technique argument and returns a `bool`. It essentially returns a technique's effective output. Nothing more, nothing less.


```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    if (VM::check(VM::VMID)) {
        std::cout << "VMID technique detected a VM!\n";
    }

    if (VM::check(VM::HYPERVISOR_BIT)) {
        std::cout << "Hypervisor bit is set, most definitely a VM!\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

<br>

## `VM::add_custom()`
This function allows you to add your own custom VM detection techniques to the scoring system. The first parameter is the percentage score (0 to 100) of how likely it's a VM if your custom code returns `true`, and the second parameter should either be a lambda, a function pointer, or a `std::function<bool()>`

```cpp
// Example 1 with function pointers

bool new_technique() {
    // add your VM detection code here
    return true; 
}

VM::add_custom(50, new_technique);
```

```cpp
// Example 2 with lambdas

VM::add_custom(50, []() -> bool { 
    // add your VM detection code here
    return true; 
});

auto new_technique = []() -> bool { 
    // add your VM detection code here
    return true;
}

VM::add_custom(50, new_technique);
```

```cpp
// Example 3 with std::function

std::function<bool()> new_technique = []() -> bool {
    // add your VM detection code here
    return true;
};

VM::add_custom(50, new_technique);
```

<br>

## `VM::type()`
This will return the VM type (or architecture) as a `std::string` based on the brand found. The possible return values are listed [here](#brand-table) in the `type` column.

```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // example output: VirtualBox is a Hypervisor (type 2) VM
    std::cout << VM::brand() " is a " << VM::type() << " VM\n";
    return 0;
}
```


<br>

## `VM::conclusion()`
This will return the "conclusion" message of what the overall result is as a `std::string`. By default, there are 2 possible outputs:
- `Running on baremetal`
- `Running inside a [brand] VM`

The `[brand]` part might contain a brand or may as well be empty, depending on whether a brand has been found. Additionally, you can extend this by adding the `VM::DYNAMIC` flag which will now allow much more variadic  potential outputs:
- `Running on baremetal`
- `Very unlikely a [brand] VM`
- `Unlikely a [brand] VM`
- `Potentially a [brand] VM`
- `Might be a [brand] VM`
- `Likely a [brand] VM`
- `Very likely a [brand] VM`
- `Running inside a [brand] VM`


<br>

## `VM::detected_count()`
This will fetch the number of techniques that have been detected as a `std::uint8_t`. Can't get any more simpler than that.
```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    const std::uint8_t count = VM::detected_count();

    // output: 7 techniques were detected
    std::cout << count << " techniques were detected" << "\n"; 

    // note that if it's baremetal, it should be 0.
    // if it's a VM, it should have at least 4 to  
    // maybe around 15 max. The most I've seen was 
    // around 18 but that only occurs very rarely.

    return 0;
}
```

<br>

## `VM::flag_to_string()`
This will take a technique flag enum as an argument and return the string version of it. For example:
```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    const std::string name = VM::flag_to_string(VM::VMID);

    // output: VM::VMID 
    std::cout << "VM::" << name << "\n"; 

    return 0;
}
```

The reason why this exists is because it can be useful for debugging purposes. It should be noted that the "VM::" part is not included in the string output, so that's based on the programmer's choice if it should remain in the string or not. The example given above is obviously useless since the whole code can be manually handwritten, but the function is especially convenient if it's being used with [`VM::technique_vector`](#variables). For example:

```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // this will loop through all the enums in the technique_vector variable,
    // and then checks each of them and outputs the enum that was detected
    for (const auto technique_enum : VM::technique_vector) {
        if (VM::check(technique_enum)) {
            const std::string name = VM::flag_to_string(technique_enum);
            std::cout << "VM::" << name << " was detected\n";
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

<br>

## `VM::detected_enums()`
This is a function that will return a vector of all the technique flags that were detected as running in a VM. The return type is `std::vector<VM::enum_flags>`, and it's designed to give a more programmatic overview of the result. 

```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<VM::enum_flags> flag_list = VM::detected_enums();

    for (const auto flag : flag_list) {
        std::cout << "VM::" << VM::flag_to_string(flag) << " was detected" << "\n"; 
    }

    return 0;
}
```

<br>

# vmaware struct
If you prefer having an object to store all the relevant information about the program's environment instead of calling static member functions, you can use the `VM::vmaware` struct:

```cpp
struct vmaware {
    std::string brand;
    std::string type;
    std::string conclusion;
    bool is_vm;
    std::uint8_t percentage;
    std::uint8_t detected_count;
    std::uint8_t technique_count;
}; 
```

example:
```cpp
#include "vmaware.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    VM::vmaware vm;

    std::cout << "Is this a VM? = " << vm.is_vm << "\n";
    std::cout << "How many techniques detected a VM? = " << vm.detected_count << "%\n";
    std::cout << "What's the VM's type? = " << vm.type << "%\n";
    std::cout << "What's the overview in a human-readable message?" << vm.conclusion << "\n";
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> the flag system is compatible for the struct constructor.

# Flag table
VMAware provides a convenient way to not only check for VMs, but also have the flexibility and freedom for the end-user to choose what techniques are used with complete control over what gets executed or not. This is handled with a flag system.

# Setting flags
| Flag | Description | Specific to |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `VM::ALL` | This will enable all the technique flags, including checks that are disabled by default. |  |
| `VM::NO_MEMO` | This will disable memoization, meaning the result will not be fetched through a previous computation of the techniques. For example, if you run all the techniques with VM::detect(), this will save all the technique results in a small cache and if you decide to use VM::percentage() afterwards, the result for that function will retrieve the precomputed results from that cache. Use this if you're only using a single total number of functions from the `VM` struct so that no unnecessary caching will be performed. |  |
| `VM::DEFAULT` | This represents a range of flags which are enabled if no default argument is provided. |
| `VM::MULTIPLE` | This will basically return a `std::string` message of what brands could be involved. For example, it could return "`VMware or VirtualBox`" instead of having a single brand string output. | VM::brand() |   
| `VM::HIGH_THRESHOLD` | This will set the threshold bar to confidently detect a VM by 3x higher. | VM::detect() and VM::percentage() |
| `VM::DYNAMIC` | This will add 8 options to the conclusion message rather than 2, each with their own varying likelihoods. | VM::conclusion() |
| `VM::NULL_ARG` | Does nothing, meant as a placeholder flag mainly for CLI purposes. It's best to ignore this.|  |

<br>

# Variables
| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `VM::technique_count` | `std::uint16_t` | This will store the number of VM detection techniques |
| `VM::technique_vector` | `std::vector<std::uint8_t>` | This will store all the technique macros as a vector. Useful if you're trying to loop through all the techniques for whatever operation you're performing. |

<br>

# CLI documentation
| Shorthand | Full command | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| -h | --help | Prints the help menu |
| -v | --version | Prints the version and miscellaneous details |
| -d | --detect | Prints the VM detection result (1 = VM, 0 = baremetal) |
| -s | --stdout | Returns either 0 or 1 to STDOUT without any text output (0 = VM, 1 = baremetal) |
| -b | --brand | Prints the most likely brand |
| -l | --brand-list | Prints all the possible VM brand strings the CLI supports |
| -c | --conclusion | Prints the conclusion message string |
| -p | --percent | Prints the VM likeliness percentage between 0 and 100 |
| -n | --number | Prints the number of VM detection techniques it can perform |
| -t | --type | Returns the VM type (if a VM was found) |
|    | --disable-notes | No notes will be provided |
|    | --high-threshold | A higher theshold bar for a VM detection will be applied |
|    | --no-ansi | Removes all the ANSI encodings (color and text style). This is added due to some terminals not supporting ANSI escape codes while cluttering the output |
|    | --dynamic | allow the conclusion message to be dynamic (8 possibilities instead of only 2) |
|    | --verbose | add more information to the output  |
|    | --compact | ignore the unsupported techniques from the CLI output and thus make it more compact |
|    | --mit | ignore the GPL techniques and run only the MIT-supported ones |
|    | --enums | display the technique enum name used by the lib |
> [!NOTE]
> If you want a general result with the default settings, do not put any arguments. This is the intended way to use the CLI tool.
